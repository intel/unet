# Deep Learning Medical Decathlon Demos for Python*
### U-Net Biomedical Image Segmentation with Medical Decathlon Dataset.

This repository contains [2D](https://github.com/IntelAI/unet/tree/master/2D) and [3D](https://github.com/IntelAI/unet/tree/master/3D) U-Net TensorFlow scripts for training models using the [Medical Decathlon](http://medicaldecathlon.com/) dataset (http://medicaldecathlon.com/).
